MMS1 is a protein that protects against replication-dependent DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MMS1 belongs to the DDB1 family of cullin 4 adaptors and the two proteins are homologous. MMS1 bridges the interaction of MMS22 and Crt10 with Cul8/Rtt101. Cul8/Rtt101 is a cullin protein involved in the regulation of DNA replication subsequent to DNA damage. The N-terminal region of MMS1 and the C-terminal of MMS22 are required for the the MMS1-MMS22 interaction. The human HIV-1 virion-associated protein Vpr assembles with DDB1 through interaction with DCAF1 (chromatin assembly factor) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets cellular substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation and subsequent G2 arrest.

MMS1 is a protein that protects against replication-dependent DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MMS1 belongs to the DDB1 family of cullin 4 adaptors and the two proteins are homologous. MMS1 bridges the interaction of MMS22 and Crt10 with Cul8/Rtt101. Cul8/Rtt101 is a cullin protein involved in the regulation of DNA replication subsequent to DNA damage. The N-terminal region of MMS1 and the C-terminal of MMS22 are required for the the MMS1-MMS22 interaction. The human HIV-1 virion-associated protein Vpr assembles with DDB1 through interaction with DCAF1 (chromatin assembly factor) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets cellular substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation and subsequent G2 arrest.
S.townsendi_DDB1_DNA_damagebinding_protein_1	1140	789	1099	2.64e-92	pfam03178, CPSF_A, CPSF A subunit region.  This family includes a region that lies towards the C-terminus of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) A (160 kDa) subunit. CPSF is involved in mRNA polyadenylation and binds the AAUAAA conserved sequence in pre-mRNA. CPSF has also been found to be necessary for splicing of single-intron pre-mRNAs. The function of the aligned region is unknown but may be involved in RNA/DNA binding.
